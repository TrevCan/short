# Short. simple http server written in C

not really my software, more
like a copy/ learning experience from
< https://bruinsslot.jp/post/simple-http-webserver-in-c/ >


### features
- returns headers
- url shortening service


Well, I've update this main.c file and it now spits the whole request (given
that it's less than 2000 bytes) when the GET Location contains the substring
`head`. Therefore, `header`,`headss`,`head*` will all respond to the same
function.

I'm also planning on adding a url request service to redirect it and shorten
it.
Even a small file hosting service would be nice. With a simple interface
available
thru curl and http(s) forms.


I do not plan on using any fancy data structures, in case you were wondering
why I wasn't using mySQL or uwsgi or any fancy stack. I'm trying to go
from the simplest thing here and create an MVP (minimal viable product).
